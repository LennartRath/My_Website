# Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r}
#  create the plot
ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x=date, y= value))+
  # add line, add colours
  geom_line(size= 1, alpha =1, aes(colour= factor(duration)))+
  # facetwrap by duration to create separate charts
  facet_wrap(~duration, nrow = 5)+
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Yields on U.S. Treasury Rates since 1960', caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", y = "%", x="") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() + 
  # instead of scales = "free", try set aspect ratio (as we had some issues dispalying)
  theme(aspect.ratio=1/8) +
  # make ugly legend disappear
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r}
# Add a year column
yield_curve2 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  # and filter for only years 1999 onwards
  filter(year(date) >= 1999, year(date) <= 2021) 

# create the plot
ggplot(yield_curve2, aes(x=maturity, y= value, group = factor(month(date))))+
  # add line, add colours
  geom_line(alpha =1, aes(colour= factor(year)))+
  # facetwrap by duration to create separate charts
  facet_wrap(vars(year), nrow = 6)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("1m", "3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "3y", "5y", "7y", "10y", "20y", "30y"))+
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'US Yield Curve', caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", y = "Yield (%)", x="Maturity") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() + 
  # instead of scales = "free", try set aspect ratio (as we had some issues dispalying)
  theme(aspect.ratio=1/4) +
  # make legend disappear
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999


```{r}
# create a df that only contains wished for data series
yield_3and10 <- yield_curve %>%
  filter(series_id == "TB3MS" | series_id == "GS10")

# create the plot
ggplot(yield_3and10, aes(x=date, y= value))+
  # add line, add colours
  geom_line(size= 0.75, alpha =1, aes(colour= factor(duration), scales = "free"))+
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Yields on 3-month and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates since 1999', caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", y = "%", x="") +
  # make visuals nicer
    theme_bw() + 
  # set x axis years to show
  scale_x_date(limits = as.Date(c("1999-01-01","2021-08-01"))) +
  # set y-axis maximum (while making sure not to drop any values)
  ylim(0,7) +
  # remove legend title
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)


recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

```{r}

yield_curve_3months<- yield_curve %>%

yield_curve_10years <- yield_curve %>%

  rename(ten_year="10y")

tidyverse_yield <- yield_curve_10y_3m <- left_join(yield_curve_3months,yield_curve_10years,by="date") %>% 
  mutate(spread=ten_year-three_month) %>% 
  rename(dates2=date)


tidyverse_yield %>% 
  #Plot dates
  ggplot(aes(x=dates2)) +
  #Plot the recession lines
  geom_rect(data=recessions,aes(xmin=From,xmax=To,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),fill='darkgray',inherit.aes=FALSE,alpha=0.35)+
  
  
  scale_x_date(date_breaks="2 years",labels=date_format("%Y"),limits=as.Date(c('1959-01-01','2021-08-01')))+
  geom_line(aes(y=spread),size=0.75)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=pmax(spread,0)),fill="skyblue",alpha=0.75)+

  geom_rug(data=subset(tidyverse_yield,spread<=0),color="salmon",sides="b",alpha=0.75)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="black")+
  #Theme and title
  theme_bw()+
   labs(
    title = "Yield Curve Inversion: USA treasury rate for 10-years - 3-month",
    x = "", 
    y = "Differences in yield")+
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=13),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none" 
    )
```
